# Jerry bot reborn v2 (economic features + slash commands)
A Discord bot with economics features, I'm too lazy to explain just setup and use `/help`

**HOW TO INSTALL?**

- Have Pycord installed.
- Download the files.
- Go to .env and replace <enter your bot token here> with your Discord bot token.
- Done! Go take a look inside the code and modify changes however you want.


1/30/2025 (xVapure), the codes are made by me, do not steal my code or monetize it without my permissions. You can customize however you want. For any enquiries, email me at `vapureofficial@gmail.com`

If you want a stable version of Jerry, refer to https://github.com/xVapure/jerrybotreborn/ (which won't be receiving anymore updates and supports legacy text-based commands)
